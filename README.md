# PushApp
PUSHAPP

PushApp is a workflow automation application.  Simply put, it copies files from one folder to another.  The intent is:

1.	Reduce the number of steps required to copy data.
2.	Eliminate errors when copying data manually.

EPIC
The user wants to copy image files generated by a scanning workstation to an image editing workstation.  The user wants to simplify that copy process.  The user doesnâ€™t want to have to use Windows Explorer to manually Copy/Move files.  The user does not use the scanning workstation frequently so they may be prone to making mistakes.  The file management features in the scanning application are clumsy and have limited capability.

SCANNING WORK STATION
A legacy film scanning application (2005) creates files in a specific location on the file system. The application is not compatible with current Windows 7/10.  The application must run on Win XP.  The user has purchased a Laptop PC and installed XP to support the application. The source code for the legacy application is not available. 

The laptop must not be updated with new drivers.  Changes will cause the legacy application to fail.  The legacy application will function with .NET 4.0 installed.

This laptop must not be connected to the internet directly but must be able to connect to the edit workstation.  

EDIT WORKSTATION
The edit workstation is a Win 7/10 PC.  A second Ethernet card provides a link to the scanning workstation.  This P2P network is in a different domain so the scanning workstation is protected.

Comments:  This is un-factored code.  There are many duplicate blocks of code that will be refactored before release.  There are many constant values related to configuration that will be removed.  This code has not been heavy tested but does work properly in XP.  This code is available to review and comment.  This code is not ready for release.

FEATURE BRANCH - Redesign MainForm Status UI
The user should be able to look at the Main Form and quickly determin the current configuration and processing status of the application.  This ability should be available when the details are visible or hidden. The user should be able to detirmin these configuration characteristics. The user should be able to determin these processing statuses.

USER STORY
The current MainForm UI has static text labeling the Source Folder and Taarget Folder.
--
As a user, I want to be able to look at the MainForm and see the actual Source and Target Folder Path.

USER STORY
The current MainForm UI does not display the current File Extension Filter.
--
As a user, I want to see the current File Extension Filter.

USER STORY
The current Status List box displays each file processing status.  The status List Box has a scroll bar.
--
As a user, I want to see a summary of the processing.  Individual files are not helpful because there are too many files to look at.  I want to know these things:
1) Number of files Copied/Moved
2) Number of files Skipped
3) Number of Files Renamed
4) Cleanup completed
5) Processing Success
6) Processing Canceled
