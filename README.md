DEVELOPER COMMENT

-----------------------------------

This code is actively under development.  Early check-ins may contain un-factored code and large blocks of commented-out code.  Early check-ins may contain undiscovered bugs, and constants that will eventually be removed.

Early development check-ins serve the purpose of providing 'real' code samples for potential clients to review.  Under normal circumstances, un-factored, commented-out code blocks and bugs would NOT be checked-in to the remote repository (GitHub).
