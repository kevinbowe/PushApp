Enhance Main UI

-----------------------------------

USE CASE

-----------------------------------

Enhance the Main UI, Form1.  The user should be able to modify the size the whole UI and the Source and Target ListView controls.  The user should be able to hide the Source and Target ListView.

If the user expands or shrinks the main window frame, the controls will resize appropriately. See: ListBox1, ListView1 and ListView2.

The application will limit the minimum and maximum size of the MMain UI (Form1).

The user should be able to see more of the Source or Target ListViews by 'grabbing' a splitter control and dragging it horizontally.  

The user should be able to expand/show or collapse/hide the KistBox1 and ListBox2 controls.  This should work like the "Show details" feature in the Duplicate Files Found modal dialog.

Technical Note:

Part of this story will include renaming all of the controls in this form to something meaningful.  This may have some impact on Form2 (configuration UI).

DEVELOPER COMMENT:

-----------------------------------

This code is actively under development.  Early check-ins may contain un-factored code and large blocks of commented-out code.  Early check-ins may contain undiscovered bugs, and constants that will eventually be removed.

Early development check-ins serve the purpose of providing 'real' code samples for potential clients to review.  Under normal circumstances, un-factored, commented-out code blocks and bugs would NOT be checked-in to the remote repository (GitHub).
