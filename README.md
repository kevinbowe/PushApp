Enhance Main UI

-----------------------------------

USE CASE

-----------------------------------

Enhance the Main UI, Form1.  The user should be able to resize the whole UI and the Source and Target ListView controls.

If the user expands or shrinks the main window frame, the controls will resize appropriately. See: ListBox1, ListView1 and ListView2.

The user should be able to see more of the Source or Target ListViews by 'grabbing' a splitter control and dragging it horizontally.  

Technical Note:

Part of this story will include renaming all of the controls in this form to something meaningful.  This may have some impact on Form2 (configuration UI).

DEVELOPER COMMENT:

-----------------------------------

This code is actively under development.  Early check-ins may contain un-factored code and large blocks of commented-out code.  Early check-ins may contain undiscovered bugs, and constants that will eventually be removed.

Early development check-ins serve the purpose of providing 'real' code samples for potential clients to review.  Under normal circumstances, un-factored, commented-out code blocks and bugs would NOT be checked-in to the remote repository (GitHub).
